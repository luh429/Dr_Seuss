            <h2> About our Project </h2>
            <p> *subject to change* In this project we hope to analyze </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The distinction of characters across collections: personalities of characters compared to real life animals (using measurements and characteristics)</li>
                    <li>The most common descriptive words used </li>
                    <li> Locations in the Seuss world</li>
                    <li> Recognitions of rhyming schemes and the occurence of them throughout the collections</li>
                    <li> The use of made up words (nonsense words) only used in the Suess world</li>
            </ul>
            <p> We know that Dr.Seuss is very unique in the way he writes his books. We want to point out some of the wackiest, differentiating bits of content written, and observe any patterns. Reading these books as adults give us a differnt perspective about the storys' meanings and allow us to dive deeper into the process of Dr.Seuss's thoughts while writing the books. It will be interesting to see how much of these stories contain made up words, as well as what proportion of the content are adjectives. Because the locations that these stories take place are just as wacky as the chracters, it would be cool to know if we could make our own map of the Seuss world based on where the stories take place, and if they have connections to one another. It would also be cool to compare Seuss characters to real life animals or objects, to see similarities between the two. </p>
