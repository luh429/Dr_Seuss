            <p> We know that Dr.Seuss is very unique in the way he writes his books. We want to
                point out some of the wackiest, differentiating bits of content written, and observe
                any patterns. Reading these books as adults give us a differnt perspective about the
                storys' meanings and allow us to dive deeper into the process of Dr.Seuss's thoughts
                while writing the books. It will be interesting to see how much of these stories
                contain made up words, as well as what proportion of the content are adjectives.
                Because the locations that these stories take place are just as wacky as the
                chracters, it would be cool to know if we could make our own map of the Seuss world
                based on where the stories take place, and if they have connections to one another.
                It would also be cool to compare Seuss characters to real life animals or objects,
                to see similarities between the two. </p>
