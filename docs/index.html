            <h2> About our Project </h2>
            <p> *subject to change* In this project we hope to analyze </p>
            <p> 
                We know that Dr.Seuss is very unique in the way he writes his books. We want to point out some of the wackiest, differentiating bits of content written, and observe any patterns. Through these visuals, we wanted to show overall statistics of the collection as well as specific details about selected books within the collection. We felt it would be important to compare the number of characters and the count of lines in each book to one another. Included in the analysis of the collection of books is a network graph connecting book titles to the made up words contained in them. This can show if Dr. Seuss repeated any made-up word in order to complete rhymes or bring clarity to a story. For specific stories, we decided to make a face-sheet of specific statistics from the story. These statistics included are measurements of line count, character count, character names, sounds, made-up words.
